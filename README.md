# Kaggle-kernel-notebooks
The repository that collects all of my Kaggle kernel notebooks:
- [NLP Preprocessing and Feature Extraction Methods A-Z](https://www.kaggle.com/longtng/nlp-preprocessing-feature-extraction-methods-a-z)
  -  This notebook's motivation is to create a ready-to-made all-in-one-place of NLP preprocessing and feature extraction techniques and codes. 
- [Bank Marketing - Ensemble Learning Pipeline](https://www.kaggle.com/longtng/bank-marketing-ensemble-learning-pipeline). The purposes of this notebook are to experiment on the following topics:
  - Imbalanced Binary Classification.
  - Solving Data Leakage via Cross-Validation
  - Training pipeline
  - Hyperparameter optimization
  - Ensemble Learning Binary Classification Models (Voting, Bagging, Boosting and Stacking Classifiers)
